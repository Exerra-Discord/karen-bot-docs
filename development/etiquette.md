> Karen has an etiquette? Strange

Listen up everyone, this will address the Karen Bot etiquette

## Commit etiquette
- Only push small commits (e.g if you changed 2 files, commit one file, commit the other and only *then* push)
- Keep commit titles short and explain them in the description of the commit
- **DO NOT PUSH TO MASTER BRANCH!** Push to a new branch (e.g username-whatyouchanged and create a PR)
